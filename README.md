- 👋 Hi, I’m @erin-weeks
- 👀 I’m interested in training-development-education, data, the environment, and building equitable and inclusive communities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pretty much everything under the sun from HR-related best practices to financial analytics with a focus on Python, R, and data engineering and governance best practices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-lever projects that will grow my abilities with the above!
- 📫 Find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erinweeks/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/erinel">Kaggle</a>, or at weeksanddays@gmail.com.
